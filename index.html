      <img src='./images/bag_textured2.png' style='float: left; width: 120px; margin: 0 15px 0 0'/>  
      Ruze Fashion was established in 2010 in Edmonton Alberta, Canada by two Accountants who noticed
      that traditional messenger bags were too boring, even by accountants standards. Also the weight of
      textbooks and laptops weren’t able to be supported by most messenger bags. This transformed into
      an idea to make the best eco-friendly fashion accessories for students and professionals to use around
      the world.
